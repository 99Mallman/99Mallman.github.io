# Frederick County Housing Units
Much like the Maryland developed land gif this map was part of a larger project. The purpose was to familiarize myself with census data in Rstudio. Inspired by my first gif, I decided to look into change in housing units of Frederick county over time. The data was retrieved from [social explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2019_5yr/metadata/?ds=ACS19_5yr). It was also made using GIMP. For more information about the process of making this map click [here](https://github.com/99Mallman/99Mallman.github.io/tree/master/Fred_Housing) I didn't use the 2009 data because the census tracts changed between that year and the next.
