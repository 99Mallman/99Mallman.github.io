# Diamond Head Crater

**Project description:** 
This map was created using QGIS in the spring of 2021 for an Advanced GIS course. It depicts Hololulu's Diamond Head Crater. The map consists of several blended layers most importantly an Esri imagery basemap and a hillshade of a DEM file. 

This recreation of an aerial view of the crater is meant to invoke an appreciation for the site. The cone was formed around 300,000 years ago and isn't actually the result of an asteroid but the eruption of a volcano.
