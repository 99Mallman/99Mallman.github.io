# Diamond Head Crater

**Project description:** 
This map was created using QGIS in the spring of 2021 for an Advanced GIS course. It depicts Honolulu's Diamond Head Crater. The map consists of several blended layers most importantly an Esri imagery basemap and a hillshade of a DEM file. 

This recreation of an aerial view of the crater is meant to invoke an appreciation for the site. The cone was formed around 300,000 years ago and is the result of volcanism, not an impactor.

The data was retrieved from [NOAA](https://coast.noaa.gov/dataviewer/#/lidar/search/). A step by step guide of reconstructing this map can be found at [open.gis.lab](https://opengislab.com/blog/2018/3/20/3d-dem-visualization-in-qgis-30). The below image is of Rabbit Island off the coast of Honolulu and serves as another example of what can be done with this method.
