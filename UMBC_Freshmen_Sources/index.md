# Sources of UMBC's 2012 Freshmen

**Project description:** This map was created using ArcGIS in the fall of 2020 for an Introduction to GIS course. For this project we were tasked with joining point data to a Maryland shapefile so that we could determine the location of Unversity of Maryland, Baltimore County's largest source of freshmen in 2012. We used several ways to divide the data by area, counties, tracts, and as this one shows, zipcodes.

The highest density of freshmen origin is adjacent to the campus. Baltimore County, Montgomary, and Howard look to be the overall darkest three of the state. This means that UMBC draws a large portion of its students from the in state and the closeby cities, which then contributes to the university's high diversity. This trend would also have implications on the income of UMBC. A low percent of out of state students costs the unversity because they can't charge instate students the same price. Not only that but students living in close proximity to campus would more likely choose to commute.
