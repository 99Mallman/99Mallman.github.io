# Colorado Potato Beetle Risk

**Project description:** This map was created using Arcmaps in the fall of 2020 for an Introductions to GIS course. The measure of risk was determined by four factors: precipitation, temperature, elevation, and crop type. If all four factors were favorable for the expansion of the Colorado potato beetle then the area was given a "very high" rating.
