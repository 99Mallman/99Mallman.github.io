# Colorado Potato Beetle Risk

**Project description:** 
  This map was created using ArcGIS 10.7 in the fall of 2020 for an Introductions to GIS course. Our task was to create a map depicting the suitability ranges of the invasive Colorado potato beetle in Utah using data provided to us. The level of suitablitity of the beetles corresponds to the risk they pose to the area. The measure of risk was determined by four factors: precipitation, temperature, elevation, and crop type. If all four factors were favorable for the expansion of the beetles then the area was given a "very high" rating. Alternatively, an area of zero suitability has zero risk of becoming infested.
    
  This map suggests that very few areas of Utah are safe from the beetles' expansion. The dots of dark green run along lakes and rivers. All land appears to be within reach. The main takeaway is that prompt precautionary measures are necessary in response to the invasion. Luckily, the points of infested areas are confined to high risk areas as of the collection of the data points. Swift action could prevent spread.
