# Forested Lake Buffers in Maryland
This project serves as the final of my Advanced GIS course. It was my goal to use as many of the skills that I learned over the semester as I could into one project with the time that I had. In this case, I explored the extent to which the areas immediately adjacent to Maryland lakes are forested. There are three maps in total, each with a different function. The process by which this project was created can be found [here](https://github.com/99Mallman/99Mallman.github.io/tree/master/GES_486_Final).

## Background
Vegetated buffers surrounding lakes, rivers and streams have a myriad of [benefits](https://blog.lakefrontliving.com/benefits-creating-buffer-zone-lake-shoreline/#:~:text=Vegetative%20buffers%20can%20help%20protect,filter%20pollutants%2C%20nutrients%20and%20sediment.) to their health. They limit runoff, catch pollutants and sediments, offer a unique transitional environment for the wildlife, protect banks from erosion, and reduce flooding to name a few. The primary goal of this project was to find the extent to which Maryland lakes are actually buffered. Because the streams that feed into lakes carry their pollutants, nutrients, and sediment with them, the health of the lake will be influenced by its streams. It was my initial intention to extend my goal to the buffered area of Maryland's streams and would do so with more time. Maryland defines forest as [10% canopy cover, 120 feet wide, and an acre in area](https://dnr.maryland.gov/forests/Pages/Forest-Tree-Data.aspx#:~:text=Resolution%3A%20The%20FIA%20considers%20a,at%20least%20120%20feet%20wide). Maryland also recommends [50 to 100 foot wide buffers](https://dnr.maryland.gov/forests/Pages/programapps/ripfbi.aspx#:~:text=Buffer%20widths%20of%2050%2D100,quality%20and%20fish%20habitat%20improvement). I decided to use 100 foot buffers for this project. 

By extention, the primary contributor of harmful substances in lakes and streams is agriculture. Irrigation can lower the base flow of streams. Pesticides are commonly carried by rain into waterbodies and intense cultrivation can increase [bank erosion](https://www.shorelandmanagement.org/quick/ea.html#:~:text=Base%20flow%20in%20nearby%20streams,load%20in%20lakes%20and%20rivers.&text=Increased%20sediment%20can%20reduce%20flood,flows%2C%20habitat%2C%20and%20aesthetics.). Runoff carrying manure, containing nitrogen and phosphorous, in large concentrations have been known to facilitate [dead zones](https://www.cbf.org/issues/dead-zones/index.html#:~:text=When%20there%20are%20excessive%20amounts,oxygen%20from%20the%20surrounding%20water.). In an attempt to at least partially account for this I included a bivariate map comparing agricultural workers with the forested buffer area.

## Description
This map relates several factors. At the bottom is a basemap for spatial reference. Above that is a choropleth map of each county's percent area of lake buffer area that contains forest, or more accurately 10% or more canopy cover. A dark colored county represents one that, for the most part, has vegetation surrounding its lakes. The process by which this was done can be found in the link above. Above that still is a raster file of Maryland canopy cover. It serves as comparison between a county's percentage and shown canopy. The data for this file is unfortunately incomplete, as you can see. Large chunks of data are missing, in some cases because of unaccounted for water but this isn't always the case. A notable missing section extends between Carroll and Baltimore county. The canopy cover data set is also in 30 meter resolution. Lastly, laid on top, are the Maryland lakes. The streams and their buffers were not included so not to cluster the map.

For a closer look, explore each lake in turn [here](/GES_486_Final/Bin/MD_lakes_webmap/index), at this webmap. You'll notice that the webmap doesn't contain the canopy cover file that I used to find the buffer areas without vegetation. It has been replaced by the ESRI imagery basemap for two reasons. The first is that the raster file was too large and caused a highly delayed response time of any inputs to the system. It made navigating the webmap nearly impossible. I chose to replace it with the ESRI imagery basemap because it serves as an interesting comparison and an accuracy check. There is a visible difference between what the raster file picked up as vegetation and what the imagery shows. It's important to note they aren't exactly equivalent. The raster has a 30 meter resolution and is measuring canopy coverage at 10% or more. Each cell is thus generalized while the imagery is more of an eyeball comparison.
