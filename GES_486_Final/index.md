# Forested Lake Buffers in Maryland
This project serves as the final of my Advanced GIS course. It was my goal to compile as many skills I had learned over the semester into one project as I could with the time that I had. In this case, I explored the extent to which the areas immediately adjacent to Maryland lakes are forested. There are three maps in total, each with a different function. The process by which this project was created can be found [here](https://github.com/99Mallman/99Mallman.github.io/tree/master/GES_486_Final).

For a closer look, explore each lake in turn [here](/GES_486_Final/Bin/MD_Webmap/index), at this web map. As a friendly warning, this web map contains large datasets and is slow to respond. I recommend navigating through use of the + and - signs or by clicking on the lakes.
