# Baltimore City Median Gross Rent and Percentage Below Poverty Line Comparison
### GES 486, lab 6
This directory is structured to effectively document the process of this project. Any raw data and their sources used in the making of this project can be found in the data folder. The bin folder contains any tampered data sets after transformations have been made. Any files in there can be viewed as intermediate steps made between retrieving the raw data and the final output.

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-read bivariate map comparing the percentage of households with incomes below the poverty level and the median gross rent by Baltimore City tract. 

## Data


## Transformations and Process

### Rstudio

### QGIS
While Rstudio was used to retrieve the data and create the fields we would use, QGIS was used to display the information. A bivariate map requires two separate layers each of a  different variable. For more information about the method visit [bnhr.xyz](https://bnhr.xyz/2019/09/15/bivariate-choropleths-in-qgis.html). How to classify the data was the most important decision in this stage of the project. I decided to use natural breaks for the poverty percentage change because it did well to organize the data between tracts with negative change, near zero, and positive.
