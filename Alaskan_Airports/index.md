# Alaskan Airports of Southern Alaska

**Project description:** 
This map was created using QGIS in the spring of 2021 for an Advanced GIS course. It depicts several airports in Alaska around the Aleutian Mountain Range. The mountains are exaggerated in elevation by times 10 for the sake of a more clear display.

Although the map is little more than an image and makes no statements, it does have a unspoken implication. Airports are vital in Alaska. The map only shows a small portion of Alaska and yet still contains over a dozen airports because, while the population of the state is low, the state is large and traveling long distances is difficult. Resources have to be imported in, making the ports like lifelines.
