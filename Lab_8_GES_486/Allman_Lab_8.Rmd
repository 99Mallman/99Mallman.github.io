## Downloading data

**1. Use `tidycensus` to download 1. race/ethnicity (B03002) and 2. median household income for Baltimore City. Store this data in a new object. Choose which race/ethnicity you'd like to relate to income (Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White work best). Which census tract has the highest _percentage_ of your target race/ethnicity (and what is the percent) and which has the highest median household income (and how much is it?)? (5 points)** Reminder: Since we will be mapping our data, make sure you include use `geometry = TRUE` in `get_acs()` 

```{r download} 
# Download total population, population of Blacks, and median household income ACS 2019 Census data from https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2019_5yr/metadata/?ds=ACS19_5yr for Maine tracts.
Balt_income_race = get_acs(geography = "tract",
      variables = c("total_pop" = "B03002_001",# Total population
                    "Blck_NonH" = "B03002_004", # Non-Hispanic Black population
                    "income" = "B19013_001"), # Median household income
      year = 2019,
survey = "acs5",
state = c(24),  # FIPS code for Maryland
county = c(510), # FIPS code for Baltimore City
geometry = TRUE,
output = "wide")

# Compute the percent of the population that is Black.
Balt_income_race$Percent_Blck = (Balt_income_race$Blck_NonHE / Balt_income_race$total_popE)

# Create a sf object.
st_as_sf(Balt_income_race)
```

**2. Which census tract has the highest percentage of Black people? (and what is the percent) and which has the highest median household income (and how much is it?)? (5 points)**
```{r max}
Balt_income_race %>%
  filter(Percent_Blck == max(Percent_Blck, na.rm = TRUE))

Balt_income_race %>%
  filter(incomeE == max(incomeE, na.rm = TRUE))

# 1.) The tract with the largest percentage of Black people, which equals 99.32%, is number 2007.02. The tract with the highest median house hold income is number 2711.02 and equals $195,156.
```

**2. Please reproject this data to Web Mercator. (1 points)**
```{r transform}
Balt_income_race = st_transform(Balt_income_race, crs = 3857)

st_crs(Balt_income_race)
```

**3. Create two plots. In the first plot highlight the tract with the highest concentration of your selected race/eth. In the second plot highlight the tract with the highest median household income? (5 points)**

```{r plot concentration}
library(dplyr)

# Define a variable equivalent to the tract with the highest Black percentage.
Max_percent = Balt_income_race %>%
  filter(Percent_Blck == max(Percent_Blck, na.rm = TRUE)) 

ggplot(Balt_income_race) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = cut_number(Percent_Blck, 4))) +
  geom_sf(data = Max_percent, color = "yellow", fill = "yellow") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "seq", palette = 1,
                    name = "Percent of Pop that is Black") +
  labs(title = "Percent of Baltimore City's Non-Hispanic Black Population") +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  theme_bw()
```
```{r plot income}
# Define a variable equivalent to the tract with the highest median income.
Max_income = Balt_income_race %>%
  filter(incomeE == max(incomeE, na.rm = TRUE)) 

ggplot(Balt_income_race) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = cut_number(incomeE, 4))) +
  geom_sf(data = Max_income, color = "yellow", fill = "yellow") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "seq", palette = 1,
                    name = "Median Household Income") +
  labs(title = "Median Household Income in Baltimore City") +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  theme_bw()
```

**4. Create a third column using the bi_class function from the tutorial. (2 points)**
```{r bivariate class}
library(biscale)

# Create classes
Balt_income_race = bi_class(Balt_income_race, x = Percent_Blck, y = incomeE, style = "jenks", dim = 3)
```

**5. Create a bivariate map with your data. (3 points)**  
```{r bivariate map, results = 'hide'}

# create map
bivariate = ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = Balt_income_race, mapping = aes(fill = bi_class), color = "white", size = 0.1, show.legend = FALSE) +
  bi_scale_fill(pal = "DkViolet", dim = 3) +
  labs(title = "Income and Percent Black People in Baltimore City",
    subtitle = "Dark Violet Palette") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12))
  bi_theme()
```

```{r plot bivariate map (no legend)}
plot(bivariate)
```

**6. Use the cowplot package and ggdraw, like in the tutorial to add a legend (2 points)**.
```{r adding legend}
# Create the legend
legend = bi_legend(pal = "DkViolet",
                    dim = 3,
                    xlab = " Higher % NonHis Black ",
                    ylab = " Higher Income ",
                    size = 8)

# Install cowplot if you haven't already 
library(cowplot)

Final_map = ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(bivariate, 0, 0, .8, 1) +
  draw_plot(legend, .70, .15, 0.35, 0.35)

plot(Final_map)
```

**7. Rinse and repeat for another county of your choosing, using a _different_ color scheme. Be sure to use Psuedo-Mercator (3857). (5 points)**
```{r Howard County download}
Howard_income_race = get_acs(geography = "tract",

## 3. Reflection (3 points)

When I compare this lab to the last one, which shared many similarities, I'm impressed by how much a difficult lab can teach you. This lab went much smoother for me than the last and I attribute that to what I learned from the previous one. I had to alter my method from before for part 2 because using `max(Balt_income_race$Percent_Blck, na.rm = TRUE)` would cut the returned value at a certain number of decimals but I needed the whole thing if I was to use `subset()`. So I instead used `filter()` combined with `max()` which worked even better. The next obstacle was figuring out how to highlight certain tracts which only required defining a variable and an extra `geom_sf()` line with a different color fill. [Python and R Tips](https://cmdlinetips.com/2019/05/how-to-highlight-select-data-points-with-ggplot2-in-r/) was a useful guide. The last new obstacle was creating bivariates in R instead of QGIS. I had to play around with what data classification method I used but with the [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biscale/vignettes/biscale.html) at hand I didn't face much difficulty. It's quite a powerful tool, faster than QGIS, and something I will surely use again.

I had no major issues in QGIS safe for after I exported the web map. It had no legend and it took much trial and error in notepad working on that code before I managed to not only include a photo of the legend, but position it correctly. After that I had to look up how to position the layers because my legend was set behind the base map, giving it a transparent look which isn't useful for comparing colors. I learned that I could set the base map's z-index to a negative value to place it in the background and the rest was uploading it to GitHub, which I now have practice in.

In regards to the data, I don't believe there was much to be surprised about for Baltimore City. The red tracts, representing dense populations of Black people and low income, resembled the famous "Black Butterfly" pattern. When compared to Howard County the city house a much larger percentage of Black people and, although the values aren't depicted in the maps, appears much more wealthy. What I'm most glad to learn from this lab is that I've made noticable progress. It's an inspiring thought.
