# Percent of Developed Land in Maryland
This map is part of a larger project in which I was tasked with creating a gif. It was made using three separate maps in QGIS and then overlapping them in [GIMP](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-create-animated-gif-using-your-own-pictures-gimp/). The data was retrieved from [imap.maryland.gov](https://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/97717f333baf4e79abb7ab8098a99ee5_0). It depicts change over time of developed land by Maryland counties between 1973 and 2010.
